Documentation is an essential part of building REST APIs.  SpringDoc is a tool that simplifies the generation and maintenance of API docs based on the OpenAPI 3 specification for Spring Boot 1.x and 2.x applications.

Now we'll be able to access the docs at:

http://localhost:8080/api-docs/
The OpenAPI definitions are in JSON format by default. For yaml format, we can obtain the definitions at:

http://localhost:8080/api-docs.yaml
